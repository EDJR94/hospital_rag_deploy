## Neo4j Aura DB
Graph databases, such as Neo4j, are databases designed to represent and process data stored as a graph. Graph data consists of nodes, edges or relationships, and properties. Nodes represent entities, relationships connect entities, and properties provide additional metadata about nodes and relationships.

The relationships in this hospital is as follows:
![graph_relationships](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5222ffca-65a1-424d-9073-f33146ec921e)

Some examples of Relationships inside AuraDB:

This diagram shows you all of the nodes and relationships in the hospital system data. One useful way to think about this flowchart is to start with the Patient node and follow the relationships. A Patient has a visit at a hospital, and the hospital employs a physician to treat the visit which is covered by an insurance payer.

The three `NEO4J_` variables are used to connect to your Neo4j AuraDB instance. Follow the directions [here](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/?ref=docs-nav-get-started) to create a free instance.

The chatbot uses OpenAI/Gemini LLMs, so you'll need to create an [OpenAI API key](https://realpython.com/generate-images-with-dalle-openai-api/#get-your-openai-api-key) and store it as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

To run the app, you need to have Docker in you computer. after that run:
`docker-compose up --build`

You should be able to see your streamlit application running on `localhost:8501`
